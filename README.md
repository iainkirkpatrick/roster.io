rostering that doesn't suck.

#APPROACH

- following the approach by http://nicolashery.com/integrating-d3js-visualizations-in-a-react-app/ at least to begin with, of trying to de-couple the D3 and React code
- d3 'components' should have everything referential they need passed to them
- and as much as possible the React components should be plug-and-playable
